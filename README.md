### Hi there 👋
 
🔭   I’m currently learning MERN Stack Development

🤔   Exploring new technologies and developing software solutions and quick hacks.

🌱   Enthusiast in Cloud Technologies - AWS Lightsail & Google Cloud.

✍️   I love to edit films and trying out latest design trends as hobbies/side hustles.

☕   I belive, a perfect cup of coffee can be the ultimate solution for any stress.
